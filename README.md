# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains a collection of **applied data analysis projects**, developed to demonstrate end-to-end analytical workflows including data generation, cleaning, exploratory analysis, modelling, and reporting.

These projects primarily focus on **general data analysis and business analytics use cases** across different industries.

## Projects

### [VLCC Fleet Utilisation Analysis](https://github.com/HSSC01/Data_Analysis/tree/main/VLCC%20Fleet%20Utilisation)
A data analysis and reporting simulation project focusing on operational fleet efficiency in the maritime shipping industry (VLCC tankers).

The project analyses monthly fleet activity data (Idle, Loaded, Ballast days) to calculate utilisation rates, identify underperforming vessels and routes, and produce structured, actionable insights related to asset deployment and operational efficiency.

**Skills:**  
Python, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Outlier Detection, Business Reporting, Visual Storytelling

### [Retail Chain Analysis](https://github.com/HSSC01/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Retail%20Chain%20Project)
An end-to-end data analysis project simulating a retail chain’s operations using **1.5 million rows of self-generated synthetic data**.

Key components include:
- **Python**: Generation of realistic, noisy transactional datasets  
- **SQL**: Data cleaning, transformation, and joins executed within Python  
- **EDA & Reporting**: Identification of trends, seasonality, and performance drivers  

**Skills:**  
Python, SQL, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualisation

### [Telco Customer Churn Analysis](https://github.com/HSSC01/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Telco%20Customer%20Churn)
An applied machine learning project completed as part of an **IBM data science course**, focusing on customer churn analysis in the telecommunications sector.

The project includes exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of supervised classification models to identify key drivers of customer attrition.

**Skills:**  
Python, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualisation, Feature Engineering, Supervised Machine Learning, Model Pipelines
